              Welcome to my about page! Now, I won't go into much detail about myself however, I
              don't believe that any more is necessary. Well I'm a 16 year old boy who studies at
              Tullinge gymnasium, which is a lovely medium sized highschool. On this website I will
              mostly display stuff that I've done in class. Especially the class called "digitalt
              skapande". We work with several different 3D programs however, I believe that blender
              is the superior program. Why? Because it's free, brilliant and most importantly, easy.
              There's not much else left to say about me. If you have any further questions please
              do not hesitate to contact me!
