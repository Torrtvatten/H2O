              Welcome to my about page! My name's Max and I made this website! Now, I won't go into
              much detail about myself however, I don't believe that much is necessary. Well I'm a
              16 year old who studies at Tullinge gymnasium, which is a lovely medium sized
              highschool. On this website I will mostly display stuff that I've done in class.
              Especially the class called "digitalt skapande". We work with several different 3D
              programs however, I believe that blender is the superior program. Why? Because it's
              free, brilliant and most importantly, easy. There's not much else left to say about
              me. If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact&nbspme!
